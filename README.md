# Grateful Today
Grateful Today Android app helps you celebrate daily blessings through building your very own digital 
gratitude board. Meditate with your gratitude board daily to see the maximum benifit of taking daily 
gratitudes. Enjoy extra gratitude time if you are feeling down, low on fortitude, or just looking for 
a boost in energy. 

## Getting Started
Open and run the project in AndroidStudio. When you open the project, you will see your gratitude board 
and a word cloud of gratitudes. (Currently, it loads a small sample of gratitudes for demonstration.) 
From the main screen you can: 

#### 1. open the daily gratitude window to add a new gratitude
Click the **"+"** button in the upper right hand corner to open the daily gratitude window. Here you 
will be prompted with "Today I am grateful for" and a space to put your gratitude. If you decide you 
don't want to enter a gratitude, click the back button in the upper left hand corner. Enter the new 
gratitude, and click the checkmark in the upper right hand corner to save the new gratitude to the 
word cloud. The gratitude board will be repopulated with the new gratitude.

## Lesson Learned
I am very excited to have the opertunity to combine my art with technology. A simple, practical design 
can provide surprisingly intreging results. A little bit of planning enables a smooth and enjoyable 
workflow later on, often saving hours and frustration. (Measure twise, cut once?)

## Future Work
I am still working on implementing data persitence. Currently, the whole list is saved as an array list 
of strings, which is then passed to the word-cloud.js as a string, which is then parsed. The current 
implementation only supports single word strings. I am considering options to expand this to gratitude 
phrases.
